    Section 8: How to create a form in HTML and send data to a PHP script

/*
    CHALLENGE: TEMPRETURE CONVERSION
    --------------------------------

    This task has been designed to test your ability to use a HTML form 
    and send data to a PHP script.


    TASK
    ----

    Design a HTML form to accept input data from the user.
    
    The user should be able to enter:
        ● temperature
        ● select from oC or oF

    This data will be sent to a PHP script where you will then 
    convert the temperature from oC to oF or vice-versa.

    The formula to convert from oF to oC is:
        C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9

    The formula to convert from oC to oF is:
        F = C * 9 / 5 + 32

    
    HINTS AND TIPS
    --------------

    You will also need to use a conditional statement (IF statement). 
    This will check the user input. IF they select oC then do one conversion 
    ELSE do the other.

    You may wish to round answers to the nearest degree or 1 decimal place.


    EXTENSION
    ---------

    Add another input to your form to allow the user to specify the degree 
    of accuracy e.g. whole number answer, 1 decimal place, 2 decimal places etc
